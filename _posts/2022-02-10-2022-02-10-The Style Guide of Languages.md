There are a bunch of style guides, and I think it is helpful to read style guides, especially when I begin to write with a programming language I nearly used to.

- [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
- [Protocol Buffers Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style)

Python

- [PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

The preferable indentation is **two** spaces in C++ and **four** spaces in Python.

I will keep this post updated later.
