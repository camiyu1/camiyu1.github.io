Nowadays, I got to be interested in ELK = Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana.
ELK has been adopted by many companies because of its flexiblity and many use cases.

ELK has one more additional component, Beat. So the naming of ELK is changed to be Elastic Stack.

I decided to try Elastic Stack, and Docker is a nice way to evaluate deployments quickly.

So I started to find out related topics and figured out a GitHub repository.

`https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk`

With the help of Docker and Docker-compose, I can easily implement Elastic Stack into my dev. PC.

It takes at most 3 minutes to launch Elastic Stack initially.
