There are a bunch of style guides, and I think it is helpful to read style guides, especially when I begin to write with a programming language I'm not used to.

**C++ / C**

- [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
- [C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines)
- [PEP 7 -- Style Guide for C Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0007/)

**Python**

- [PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

**Protocol Buffers**

- [Protocol Buffers Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style)

One interesting thing is that the preferable indentation is **two** spaces in C++ and **four** spaces in Python and C.
Sometimes developers use a set of multiple guidelines to build their coding guideline like [this](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/blob/main/CODING-GUIDELINES.md).

I will keep this post updated later.
